# VideoMosaicking
Final Project
EN.525.759 Image Compression, Packet Video, and Video Processing

Objective
Study the methods, performance, and limitations of video mosaicking. Video mosaicking is the
process of combining individual video frames together in order to form a cohesive panoramic view of the
scene. This is a multi-step process, including significant image processing tasks such as image registration,
correspondence, transformation, and stitching. Military and commercial applications include satellite
imagery, constructing high resolution photographic maps, virtual tourism, and virtual reality scene
generation.

Approach
Read available research papers on video/image mosaicking as well as the subsystem processes.
Implement a subset of the mosaicking algorithms and subsystem processesing in MATLAB. Create a graphical
user interface which will provide a user friendly framework and facilitate performance investigation.
Obtain or generate a significantly varied data set to conduct research and identify performance and
limitations.
